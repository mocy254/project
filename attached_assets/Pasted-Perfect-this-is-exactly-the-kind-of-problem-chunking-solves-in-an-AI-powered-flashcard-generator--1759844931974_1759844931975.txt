Perfect — this is exactly the kind of problem chunking solves in an AI-powered flashcard generator.

Let’s break it down step-by-step so you can handle large PDFs (like First Aid Step 1) without losing info when using Gemini 2.5 Flash (Pro) or any large language model API.


---

🧩 The Problem

When you upload a large file:

You probably send the entire text to the model in one request.

If the file is too big, the model truncates or skips sections to fit into its context window (even though Gemini’s context is large, it's still finite — usually 1M tokens for 2.5 Pro).

Result: Missed topics, incomplete flashcards, and loss of coherence.

✅ The Fix — Intelligent Chunking by Topics

Instead of random or size-based splits, you can chunk by semantic structure (topics, subtopics, headings).

1️⃣ Step 1: Extract Text + Structure

After parsing the PDF (using PyMuPDF, PDF.js, or a tool like unstructured), identify:

Headings (bold, larger font, or numbered)

Subheadings

Paragraphs

Tables/images (mark placeholders)


📘 Example:

Chapter: Cardiovascular System
Section: Heart Failure
Subsection: Pathophysiology
Text: ...


---

2️⃣ Step 2: Group Text into Topic Chunks

Then group related sections until each chunk is under your model’s safe token limit, e.g.:

Gemini 2.5 Flash → ~100K tokens is okay for safety.

So make chunks of ~20–50K tokens each.


Use a hierarchical grouping:

[Topic: Cardiovascular Diseases]
    - Heart Failure
    - Hypertension
    - Valvular Disorders

Each topic chunk is then processed individually by the model.


---

3️⃣ Step 3: Topic Summarization Pass (Optional)

Before generating flashcards, you can run an analysis pass:

> “Analyze this content and output a structured outline of topics and subtopics.”



Then feed each section back in for flashcard generation with:

> “Generate flashcards covering this section (coverage level X of 7).”



This ensures no topics are skipped and cards remain organized by topic.


---

4️⃣ Step 4: Parallel Processing (if API supports)

You can process chunks concurrently — each chunk → one request.
Later, merge all flashcards and organize them by topic.


---

5️⃣ Example Flow (Pseudocode)

const chunks = splitByTopics(extractPdfContent(pdfFile));

for (const chunk of chunks) {
  const flashcards = await generateFlashcards(chunk.text, coverageLevel);
  saveToDeck(chunk.topic, flashcards);
}


---

6️⃣ Prompts to Use

Prompt for topic analysis:

> “Analyze this document section and output a JSON list of topics and subtopics in hierarchical order.”



Prompt for flashcard generation:

> “Generate flashcards from the following content. Ensure complete coverage of all facts, definitions, mechanisms, and relationships. Coverage level: 5/7.”

⚙️ Bonus Tips

Always run a “topic outline pass” first for large files.

Keep metadata (topic name, page number, etc.) in each chunk.

Use a progressive refinement approach — coarse → detailed cards.

Store intermediate results in a database to resume easily if interrupted.

If you’d like, I can show you a ready-to-use architecture (in Node.js or Python) for how to:

1. Extract → 2. Topic-chunk → 3. Summarize → 4. Generate flashcards.



Would you like me to make that workflow in Node.js (for Gemini API) or Python?
