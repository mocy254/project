💔 You’re Studying Every Day… Yet You Still Feel Behind

You’ve watched the lectures, read First Aid, and filled your Anki decks.
But somehow, the facts still slip away.
Your Qbank scores aren’t improving. Your recall fades after a few days.
You’re spending more time making flashcards than mastering them.

And deep down, you’re exhausted.
Because medicine never stops coming — new material, new videos, new pressure.

⏰ Because Time Is the One Thing You Don’t Have
