Excellent — you’ve uploaded “ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA – Dr. Ali El-Emam”, a detailed lecture-style medical PDF.

Here’s exactly how your SaaS should approach any document like this (especially medical PDFs) to generate flashcards across coverage levels 1–7 with Gemini 2.5 Flash.


---

🧭 1. Stage 1 – Document Analysis Pipeline

Goal: Extract structure, meaning, and priority.

Step 1: Segment the PDF

Detect top-level headers and sections using patterns like:

UPPERCASE titles → main topic

Bold / underline / “Definition”, “Etiology”, “Pathophysiology”, etc. → subtopics


Example segmentation from this file:

1. General Considerations  
2. Definition of Acute Limb Ischemia  
3. Etiology  
4. Arterial Embolism  
5. Acute Arterial Thrombosis  
6. Pathological Consequences of Acute Ischemia  
7. Clinical Features (6 Ps)  
8. Investigations  
9. Treatment (Immediate, Specific, Embolism, Thrombosis, Trauma)  
10. Complications  
11. Gangrene  
12. Amputation

Step 2: Build a hierarchy

Represent as a JSON tree:

{
 "topic": "Acute Limb Ischemia",
 "sections": [
   {"name": "Definition", "importance": 5},
   {"name": "Etiology", "subsections": ["Embolism", "Thrombosis"], "importance": 7},
   {"name": "Treatment", "subsections": ["Embolectomy", "Thrombolysis"], "importance": 8},
   ...
 ]
}

Step 3: Extract atomic facts

Parse bullet points, numbered lists, and short sentences into discrete fact units:

{"fact": "Acute limb ischemia is a surgical emergency.", "importance": 9}
{"fact": "The 6 Ps of acute ischemia are pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and perishing cold.", "importance": 10}

Attach metadata:

Section → context (“Clinical features”)

Type → definition / symptom / treatment / cause

Importance → from keywords (“Definition” > core, “Complications” > supporting)

⚙️ 2. Stage 2 – Determine Content Coverage (1–7)

Map your coverage slider (1–7) to a selection function that filters facts by importance and merges context level:

Level Include facts with importance ≥ Notes

1 9–10 Only core principles
2 8–10 Key mechanisms
3 7–10 Moderate details
4 6–10 Balanced
5 5–10 Detailed
6 4–10 Near comprehensive
7 1–10 Every detail


Optionally, apply text summarization when trimming (Gemini Flash can do this inline).

🧩 3. Stage 3 – Generate Flashcards

Input Prompt Template

For each document section (≤8k tokens), send Gemini 2.5 Flash this system+user prompt:

SYSTEM:
You are an AI that creates concise, USMLE-style flashcards from medical documents.

USER:
Section: {section_name}
Coverage Level: {1–7}
Facts extracted (importance annotated):

{fact_list}

TASK:
1. Generate flashcards (Front/Back) according to the coverage level:
   - Level 1–2 → only top-importance facts.
   - Level 3–4 → include moderate detail.
   - Level 5–7 → include all.
2. Keep cards atomic, ≤30 words per side.
3. Output JSON: [{"Front": "...", "Back": "..."}]

Example result for the “6 Ps” section:

[
 {"Front":"What are the 6 Ps of acute limb ischemia?","Back":"Pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, perishing cold."},
 {"Front":"Which is the first sensory loss in acute ischemia?","Back":"Light touch, progressing to anesthesia."}
]

🚀 4. Stage 4 – Assembly & Optimization

1. Merge duplicates: unify identical facts from multiple sections.


2. Group by topic: keep cards under the same subheading for export.


3. Trim by user level: apply filters dynamically when exporting deck.


4. Export formats: JSON → CSV/Anki/Quizlet.

✅ Practical Example (from your PDF)

Input section: “Clinical Features of Acute Ischemia”

Level 1 output (Core):

“What are the 6 Ps of acute limb ischemia?” → “Pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, perishing cold.”


Level 4 output (Balanced):
